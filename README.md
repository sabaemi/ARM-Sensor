In following implementations we try to work with different sensors of stm32 microcontroller using Arm Keil MDK and STM32Cube MX:
1. Controlling light intensity of LEDs on the board using LDR (light resistance) sensor and ADC unit. In a way that when you cover the sensor, the light intensity will be reduced to minimum (off) and maximum by exposing it to flashlight. (Images are included)
2. Displaying room temperature on the left two digits of 7-segment using LM35 sensor and displaying a number from 0 to 50 on the right two digits of 7-segment using Volume. If the room temperature is higher than the specified number, an external LED and the numbers on the 7seg blink. (Image is included)
3. Displaying live date and time on LCD using RTC of stm32. If a movement is detected by the PIR sensor, the time of its occurrence will be displayed under the live time and an external LED will be lit by the relay. After 5 seconds, the occurrence time will be cleared and the relay returns to the off state.
